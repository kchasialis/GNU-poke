# GNU-poke

GNU poke is a new interactive editor for binary data. Not limited to editing basic entities such as bits and bytes, it provides a full-fledged procedural, interactive programming language designed to describe data structures and to operate on them. Once a user has defined a structure for binary data (usually matching some file format) she can search, inspect, create, shuffle and modify abstract entities such as ELF relocations, MP3 tags, DWARF expressions, partition table entries, and so on, with primitives resembling simple editing of bits and bytes. The program comes with a library of already written descriptions (or "pickles" in poke parlance) for many binary formats.

I am actively contributing to GNU poke for the Google Summer of Code program.
