Nomenclature
------------

We call ``poke`` the program.  When the context may induce confusion
(since ``poke`` is a pretty common word) then we use ``GNU poke``.

``Poke`` (with upper case ``P``) is the name of the domain-specific
language implemented by ``poke``.

A ``pickle`` is a Poke source file containing definitions of types,
variables, functions, etc, that conceptually apply to some definite
domain.  For example, ``elf.pk`` is a pickle that provides facilities
to poke ELF object files.  Pickles are not necessarily related to file
formats: a set of functions to work with bit patterns, for example,
could be implemented in a pickle ``bitpatterns.pk``.

Global Reviewers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jose E. Marchesi	<jemarch@gnu.org>

Maintainers
~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintainers are individuals who are responsible for, and have permission
to check in changes in, certain subsets of the code, and push them to
the master branch.  Note that that maintainers still need approval to
check in changes outside of the immediate domain that they maintain.

Note also that maintainers are still asked to send [COMMITTED] messages
to the list with the patches they push.  This helps to keep the other
hackers aware of what is going on in other areas.

Write After Approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The people below have write access to the git repository, and can
install their changes after getting explicit approval from a global
reviewer.

Egeyar Bagcioglu	<egeyar@gmail.com>
John Darrington		<jmd@gnu.org>
Luca Saiu		<positron@gnu.org>
Darshit Shah		<darnir@gnu.org>

Personal Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyone having write access to the git repository is allowed to push
and maintain personal branches.  These branches should be called
``WHO/WHAT``, where ``WHO`` is the nick identifying the owner of the
branch and ``WHAT`` a description of what it contains.

Example::

  jemarch/hyperlinks-server

Personal branches are intended to ease the interaction between
developers, and to provide a convenient basis for testing large
changes.

Personal branches can be rebased, and deleted.  Please do not write
into a personal branch unless you have the explicit approval of the
branch owner.

Building Release Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard target ``make distcheck`` builds a distributable sources
tarball, and tests that it can be built and tested properly.

IMPORTANT: before building a tarball, please make sure no stale files
are left in the testsuite/**/ directories, like Emacs backup files.
The EXTRA_DIST setting in testsuite/Makefile.am includes these
directories and all its contents.

Installing Obvious Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyone having write access to the git repository is allowed to push
obvious changes to non-personal branches.  The "obvious" category
includes typos in comments, renaming of variables, etc.

If you commit and push an obvious change, you are still required to
send an email to the mailing list stating you installed the change.
Please include a suggestive tag in your email's subject, something
like ``[COMMITTED]``.  Also, make sure to include the patch itself.

The Bugzilla
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We maintain a bugs database in https://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla.
Our component is ``poke``.  If you find a bug and you don't want or
you can't work on it, please file a bug there providing as much
details as you can.

Also, feel free to assign unasigned bugs to yourself.  You will have
to open an account in bugzilla for that.

If the bugzilla URL ever changes it should be updated in
``configure.ac``.

Dealing with spam in the Bugzilla
.................................

Sometimes the bugzilla at sourceware gets some spam, in the form of
bugs containing crap.  If you see one, you can flag is as spam by
transitioning the following fields::

  Component -> spam
  Product -> web
  Assigneee -> nobody@sourceware.org
  Status -> Closed as invalid


Development Environment
-----------------------

Autotools
~~~~~~~~~

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need
help2man.  All of these programs are available from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

Dejagnu
~~~~~~~

The poke testsuite uses DejaGNU.  Please install it if you intend to
run the tests.  If you want to hack poke, you definitely want to run
the tests :)

Flex
~~~~

You will need a recent version of flex, since we are using some recent
options like "reentrant" or "bison-bridge".  flex version 2.6.1 works
fine.

Bison
~~~~~

In order to improve the user's experience, we are using fairly recent
versions of bison.  Bison 3.6.0 or later is required to boostrap and
build poke from git.

readline
~~~~~~~~

Poke uses GNU libreadline in order to provide a nice line editor in
the ``(poke)`` prompt.  Any recent version will suffice.  The package
name usually is:
  - On Debian and Debian-based systems: libreadline-dev,
  - On Red Hat distributions: readline-devel.

Boehm GC
~~~~~~~~

poke uses the Boehm conservative garbage collector for managing the
memory of some of its subsystems.  Therefore, you must have it
installed.  The package name usually is:
  - On Debian and Debian-based systems: libgc-dev,
  - On Red Hat distributions: gc-devel.

Note that if you have the Boehm GC installed in a prefix different
from the one that contains pkg-config, you need to set PKL_CONFIG_PATH
so that pkg-config finds it::

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX_OF_LIBGC}/lib/pkgconfig

Jitter
~~~~~~

In order to build and run poke, you need Luca Saiu's jitter.  Jitter
is available at http://ageinghacker.net/git/cgit.cgi/jitter.

The appropriate version of Jitter is now downloaded and bootstrapped
automatically by Poke's ``bootstrap`` script, which frees the user
from the annoyance of installing Jitter as a dependency.

Configuring and compiling Poke will also compile and configure
Jitter in a subdirectory.  Jitter, when configured in ``sub-package
mode`` as Poke does, only generates static libraries and requires
no installation.

JSON-C
~~~~~~

The poke machine-interface uses a protocol to communicate with
clients, which is based on JSON.  poke uses the json-c library to
parse and build JSON strings.

If this library is not found, poke will build without MI support.

Tcl and Tk
~~~~~~~~~~

The poke GUI uses Tcl and Tk, so you need to have the respective
development packages installed in your system.  Any recent version
will suffice.

libtextstyle
~~~~~~~~~~~~

GNU poke uses libtextstyle in order to provide styled output.  If the
library is not found, then a dummy version of it from gnulib is used
instead... that does not do any styling!

At the moment libtextstyle lives in a subdirectory of GNU gettext.
See https://www.gnu.org/s/gettext for more information.

libnbd
~~~~~~

GNU poke optionally uses libnbd to expose an io space for data served
by an arbitrary NBD (Network Block Device) server.  Testing this
further requires nbdkit to quickly provide an arbitrary NBD server.
The package names are:
  - On Red Hat distributions: libnbd-devel, nbdkit-basic-plugins

See http://libguestfs.org/libnbd.3.html for more information.

Building
~~~~~~~~

After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you can
run::
  
  $ ./bootstrap --skip-po

Then, you can run ``configure``::

  $ mkdir build/ && cd build
  $ ../configure

Here, you can give as arguments to 'configure'
  - configure options, as listen in the 'configure --help' output,
  - Makefile variable assignments for building the binaries, as
    described in the INSTALL file,
  - Makefile variable assignments for building the documentation,
    for example
      MAKEINFOFLAGS="--css-ref=http://www.jemarch.net/homepage.css"
    to get HTML documentation styled like the "Applied Pokology" blog.

Finally::

  $ make
  $ make check

Building the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The poke GUI is optional and it is built by default, provided the
required dependencies are found at configure time.

To disable building the GUI, pass the ``--disable-gui`` option at
configure time.
  
Building a 32-bit poke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are in a 64-bit multilib system with support for building
32-bit binaries, you can build a 32-bit poke configuring like this::

  ../configure --host=i386-unknown-linux-gnu \
               CFLAGS='-O2 -m32'

This is of course for ``x86_64``.  In your system, replace the triplet
with the proper one for your architecture.

Gettext
~~~~~~~

When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system,
it is necessary to run gettextize -f in this hierarchy to update the
po/ infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun gnulib-tool --import since
otherwise older files will have been imported.  See the Gnulib manual
for more information.

Running an Uninstalled Poke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once poke is compiled, you can run it before installing by using the
``run`` script built into the root of your build tree; this takes care
of setting variables such as ``PATH``, ``POKEDATADIR``,
``POKESTYLESDIR``, and ``POKEPICKLESDIR`` to point at appropriate
locations.

For example::

  $ pwd
  /home/jemarch/gnu/hacks/poke/build/
  $ ./run poke

Continuous Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package is built automatically, at regular intervals.  You find the
latest build results here::
  
  https://gitlab.com/gnu-poke/ci-distcheck/pipelines
  https://gitlab.com/gnu-poke/ci-distcheck/-/jobs?scope=finished

Coding Style and Conventions
----------------------------

Writing C
~~~~~~~~~

In Poke we follow the GNU Coding Standards.  Please see
https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/.

Additionally, we have a few conventions that we ask you to follow when
hacking poke, in order to keep a coherent style when possible.  These
are documented in the following subsections.

Avoid Tabs
..........

Please format your code using spaces.  Tabs (Ascii 9) should not
appear anywhere except in Makefiles.

Avoid bool
..........

C99 defines the type ``bool``.  However, in poke we prefer to use
variables of type ``int`` in order to hold truth values.  We kindly
ask you to do the same.

When documenting functions that receive or return boolean values
stored in integer variables, please remember that the interpretation
of the truth values in C is: zero means false, and any value other
than zero means true.  Avoid referring to 1 to mean true.

Also, please never rely on a boolean to hold exactly 1 or any other
particular non-zero value, to be interpreted as true.

Use _p for Predicates
.....................

We use the venerable convention of using a suffix ``_p`` (for
predicate) when naming variables and struct fiels that contain
booleans.

We do not always do this, but it is especially important in cases
where the name of the variable is not indicative enough.

Documenting Functions in Public Headers
.......................................

Function prototypes in headers must be documented using a comment
block preceding the prototype.

Start the comment block with a terse short sentence that states what
the function does.  Then, document the arguments that the function
takes, and the value it returns, if any.  When referring to arguments
and other variables in the comment block, please use caps.

It is ok for single comment block to document more than one prototype.

Please leave an empty line between the comment block and the function
prototype.

Example::

  /* Frobnicate a frob.

     FROB is a frob that should have been previously initialized using
     frob_new.
  
     LAZY_P is a boolean.  If true, FROB won't be frobnicated
     immediately, but instead marked for later frobnication.
  
     If the frob cannot be frobnicated, this function returns NULL.
     Otherwise the function returns the given frob.  */
  
  frob_t frobnicate (frob_t frob, int lazy_p);
  frob_t forbnicate_r (frob_t frob, int lazy_p);

Writing Poke
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend to use the Emacs mode in ``etc/poke-mode.el`` to
write ``.pk`` files.

- Do not separate magnitudes and units when writing offsets.  Do it
  like this::

    16#B

  instead of::

    16 #B

- Use Camel_Case for type names, but do not use Camel_Case for
  variable/function names!

- Surround pretty-printed values with #< and >.   This is to notify
  the reader that the value has been pretty-printed.

Writing RAS
~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend to use the Emacs mode in ``etc/poke-ras-mode.el`` to
write ``.pks`` files.

Writing Tests
-------------

The poke testsuites live in the ``testsuite/`` subdirectory.  This
section contains useful hints for adding tests there.

Test framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test suite is based on DejaGnu, for which you find the general
documentation at
  https://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/manual/index.html

The documentation of specific DejaGnu directives is at
  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Directives.html
  https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/HowToPrepareATestcase

Naming Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For testing a functionality ``foo``, name your test ``foo.pk`` or
``foo-N.pk`` where ``N`` is a number.

If the test is a ``do-compile`` whose compilation is expected to fail,
name the test ``func-diag.pk`` or ``func-diag-N.pk``.  Here "diag"
means diagnostic.

Always set obase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your test relies on printing integer values in the REPL (or using
the ``%v`` formatting tag in a ``printf``) please make sure to set an
explicit output numerical base, like in::

  /* { dg-command {.set obase 10} }  */

This way, we won't have to change the tests if at some point we change
the default obase.

Put each test in its own file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are writing tests for a specific functionality, like for
example a standard function ``foo``, it may seem logical to put all
the tests in a single file ``foo.pk`` like::

  /* { dg-do run } */

  /* { dg-command {foo (1)} } */
  /* { dg-output "expected result" } */
  
  /* { dg-command {foo (1)} } */
  /* { dg-output "\nexpected result" } */

  [... and so on ...]

However, this is not a good idea.  If some of the "subtests" fail, it
becomes difficult to determine which one is the culprit looking at the
test log file.

It is better to put each test in its own file: ``foo-1.pk``,
``foo-2.pk`` and so on.

dg-output may require a newline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If despite the advise above you really need to put more than dg-output
in a dg-run test file, please be aware you need to prefix all of them
(but the first one) with a newline, like in::

  /* { dg-output "foo" } */
  /* { dg-output "\nbar" } */
  /* { dg-output "\n baz" } */

Using data files in tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your test requires mapping data, the dg-data directive is what you
need.  It has two forms.

The first form looks like::

  /* { dg-data {c*} {0x10 0x20 0x30 0x40 ...} } */

This creates a temporary file (whose name is irrelevant) and makes it
the current IO space at poke initialization time.  The test body, and
dg-commands, can then map on it.

However, sometimes you need to map on several files.  In this case,
you can have several dg-data entries with an additional argument,
which is the name of the temporary file to create::

  /* { dg-data {c*} {0x01 0x02 ...} foo.data } */
  /* { dg-data {c*} {0x11 0x12 ...} bar.data } */

  [...]

  /* { dg-command { defvar foo = open ("foo.data") } } */

The file created by the last dg-data (be it anonymous or named) is the
current IO space.

Using NBD connections in tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your test requires an NBD server (only useful when poke is compiled
with libnbd), the dg-nbd directive is what you need.  It has one form::

  /* { dg-nbd { 0x1 0x2 ...} [dg-tmpdir]/sock } */

This utilizes nbdkit to serve an in-memory disk with initial contents
over a named Unix socket.  Note that the data argument is not the same
as for dg-data (which uses tcl's binary command), but rather the
syntax accepted by nbdkit-data-plugin's data= argument, although the
two are similar.  nbdkit then creates a Unix socket server for the
data, and will be shut down gracefully when the testsuite completes.
Use of the utility directive [dg-tmpdir] ensures that the socket name
will not be too long while still respecting $TMPDIR (defaulting to a
new subdirectory of /tmp), since $objdir may be arbitrarily deep.

To use the server as an IO space, your test will then follow up with::

  /* { dg-command "open (\"nbd+unix:///?socket=[dg-tmpdir]/sock\")" } */

Writing tests that depend on a certain capability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the presence of the functionality tested may be optional.
An example is testing the support for styling, which depends on poke
to be built with libtextstyle support.

The dg-require directive can be used for this purpose.  For example,
the following test will be skipped (with status UNSUPPORTED) if the
capability ``libtextstyle`` is not found in poke::

  /* { dg-do run } */
  /* { dg-options "--color=html" } */
  /* { dg-require libtextstyle } */
  
  /* { dg-command {printf "%<foo:%i32d%>", 10} } */
  /* { dg-output "<span class=\"foo\">10</span>" } */

IMPORTANT NOTE: dg-require should appear before any dg-command
directive in the test file.

The supported capabilities are:

libtextstyle
  poke is built with libtextstyle support.
nbd
  poke is built with NBD io space support, and dg-nbd works.

Writing REPL tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Th the ``poke.repl`` testsuite is intended to test features in the
interactive usage of poke.  Therefore, it is not dg-based.  Instead,
it uses the services provided by ``testsuite/lib/poke.exp``.  In a
nutshell, these services are:

poke_start
  Run a new poke process and wait at the prompt.
poke_exit
  Exit poke.
poke_test_cmd CMD PATTERN
  Send CMD to poke, and expect the result PATTERN.  CMD is sent as
  virtual keystrokes.  Therefore, sending \t or \n has the same effect
  on the REPL than typing TAB or RET in the keyboard, respectively.
  PATTERN shouldn't include the prompt.
poke_send INPUT PATTERN
  Send INPUT to poke, and expect PATTERN as output.
poke_send_signal SIGNAL
  Send SIGNAL to poke.
  
Adding a new test to ``poke.repl`` involves editing
``poke.repl/repl.exp`` and adding some content there.  The following
subsections detail how.

Testing Pickles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each pickle in ``pickles/FOO.pk`` shall have a testsuite in
``testsuite/poke.FOO`` with a driver ``testsuite/poke.FOO/FOO.exp``.

Command REPL tests
..................

Some REPL tests need to check whether poke replies properly to some
sent command.  The ``poke_test_cmd`` procedure defined in
``testsuite/lib/poke.exp`` provides a convenient interface for this.

For example::
  
  set test "slashes are preserved"
  poke_start
  poke_test_cmd {4 / 2} {2}
  poke_exit

The snippet above implements a test named "slashes are preserved" that
runs poke and sends the command ``4 / 2`` with expected result ``2``.

The dialogue when the test above is executed is::

  (poke) 4 / 2
  2
  (poke) 

General REPL tests
..................

Other REPL tests are not about executing commands.  Suppose for
example we want to test whether tab-completion works.  We would write
something like::
  
  set test "tab-completion-2"
  poke_start
  poke_send ".e\t\t" "\r\n.editor  .exit *\r\n$poke_prompt .e"
  poke_exit

The test above uses the ``poke_send`` procedure, defined in
``testsuite/lib/poke.exp``.  This procedure gets two arguments: the
input that is sent to poke, and the expected output.  Note how usign
``poke_send`` doesn't require poke to execute any command.

Using ``poke_send`` is more laborious than using ``poke_test_cmd``: it
is necessary to explicitly include the prompt in the expected output
whenever needed.

Note also how newlines are perceived by expect as the sequence
``\r\n``.

Writing Documentation
---------------------

Documenting Pickles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chapter ``Pickles`` in the Poke manual contains several sections
organized in thematic areas.  When adding a new pickle, find the area
appropriate for the abstractions provided by the pickle (or create one
if it doesn't exist already) and add a section for it.

Please make sure to document any dependency of your pickle to other
pickles.

Keep a tutorial-like tone: for fine details, the user can always go
and look to the pickle directly.

Fuzzing poke
------------

Grammarinator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*grammarinator* is a random test generator/fuzzer that creates test
cases according to an input antlr4 grammar.

In order to generate Poke programs with grammarinator, follow the
following steps.

First of all, install grammarinator::

  $ git clone https://github.com/renatahodovan/grammarinator
  $ cd grammarinator
  $ sudo python3 setup.py install

Then, use ``grammarinator-process`` in order to create the "unparser"
and "unlexer" for poke::

  $ grammarinator-process ../path/to/poke.g4

This will create two files in the current working directory:
``pokeUnlexer.py`` and ``pokeUnparser.py``.  Next step is to use
``grammarinator-generate`` in order to create tests::

  $ grammarinator-generate -l pokeUnlexer.py -p pokeUnparser.py \
                           -r program -n 100 -d 10 \
                           -t grammarinator.runtime.simple_space_transformer

The option ``-n`` specifies the number of tests (Poke programs) to
generate.

The option ``-d`` specifies the maximum recursive level.  The bigger
the recursive level, the bigger the test files will be.  If you don't
specify a maximum recursive level then grammarinator-generate will
crash.

The option ``-t grammarinator.runtime.simple_space_transformer`` makes
sure that whitespaces get inserted between literal tokens.

Deciding on What to Work on
---------------------------

We maintain a detailed task list in the ``TODO`` file at the root of
the source tree.  Please take a look.
    
Submitting a Patch
------------------

If you hack a feature/improvement/bugfix for poke and want to get it
integrated upstream, please keep the following points in mind:

- If your patch changes the user-visible characteristics of poke,
  please include an update for the user manual.

- If your patch adds or changes the way poke works internally, in a
  significant way, please consider including an update for the
  ``HACKING`` file.

- Please include a GNU-style ChangeLog in the patch description, but
  do not include it in the thunks.  This is to ease reviewers to apply
  your patch for testing.  Of course, include the thunk in the final
  push!  (We will get rid of manual ChangeLog entries soon.)

- Make sure to run ``make syntax-check`` before submitting the patch,
  and fix any reported problem.  Note that the maintainer reviewing
  your patch will also do this, so this is a great time to save an
  iteration ;)

- Let's keep poke.git master linear... no merges please.  Pull with
  ``--ff-only``.

- Send the patch to the ``poke-devel`` mailing list.

- Use text email only.  No html please.

- Inline the patch in the body of your email, or alternatively attach
  it as ``text/x-diff`` or ``text/x-patch``.  This is to ease
  reviewers to quote parts of the patch.
    
Maintenance
-----------

This section describes ``make`` targets that performs several
maintenance tasks.

syntax-check
  Run several syntax-related checks in the source files.  It is useful
  to run this target before submitting code to be reviewed, and while
  reviewing other people's code.

  Note that sometimes the results have to be taken with a pinch of
  salt.  This happens, for example, when a rule oriented to C is
  applied to, say, an AWK file.  In these cases, consider adding a
  ``.x-sc_*`` fine-tuning file.  But please ask in poke-devel first.

  We provide a pre-push git hook that performs the syntax check right
  before pushing. If the check fails, the push is aborted. You should
  consider enabling this check by coping ``etc/git-hooks/pre-push`` to
  ``.git/hooks/``.

coverage
  This target builds *poke* with code coverage support, runs the
  testsuite, and generates a nice html report under
  ``$(top_builddir)/doc/coverage/``.  It is necessary to have the
  ``lcov`` program for this to work.

cyclo-poke.html
  This target runs the pmccabe utility to calculate the modified
  cyclomatic complexity of the functions composing the poke sources,
  and generates a nice html report.

refresh-po
  This target download the latest available translations from the
  translation project and installs them in the source tree.

update-copyright
  Run this rule once per year (usually early in January) to update all
  the copyright years in the project.  By default this excludes all
  variants of COPYING.  Exceptions to this procedure (such as
  ``ChangeLog..*`` for rotated change logs) can be added in the file
  ``.x-update-copyright``.

The bison Parser in pkl-tab.y
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only purpose of the bison parser in pkl-tab.y is to do the
syntactic analysis, build the initial AST, and set the locations of
the AST nodes.

Unfortunately, currently it also does some extra work, due to
limitations in the LARL parser:

- It builds the compile-time environment and register type, variable
  and function declarations.
- It annotates variables with their lexical addresses.
- It links return statements with their containing functions.
- It annotates return statements with he number of lexical frames they
  should pop before exiting the function.

As we shall see below, any further analysis and transformations on the
AST are performed by the compiler phases, which are implemented
elsewhere.  This greatly helps to keep the parser code clean and easy
to read, and also eases changing the syntactic structure of poke
programs.

The AST
~~~~~~~

The compiler operates on an abstract syntax tree that represent the
program being compiled.  The following subsections discuss some
aspects of the structure of the AST.

Loop Statements
...............

Loop statements are represented with trees like::

  loop_stmt
      |
      +-- [iterator]
      |       |
      |       +-- decl
      |       +-- container
      |
      +-- [condition]
      +-- body

Different kind of loop statements supported in Poke are represented
including or not including optional fields.

``while`` statements with a condition::

  while (CONDITION) BODY

are represented as::

  loop_stmt
      |
      +-- condition
      +-- body

``while`` statements without a condition::

  while () BODY

are represented as::

  loop_stmt
      |
      +-- body

``for-in`` statements::

  for (VAR in CONTAINER) BODY

are represented as::

  loop_stmt
      |
      +-- iterator
      |      |
      |      +-- decl (VAR
      |      +-- container
      |
      +-- body

``for-in-where`` statements::

  for (VAR in CONTAINER where SELECTOR) BODY

are represented as::

  loop_stmt
      |
      +-- iterator
      |      |
      |      +-- decl (VAR)
      |      +-- container
      |
      +-- condition (SELECTOR)
      +-- body


Compiler Passes and Phases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are the phases currently implemented in the poke compiler::

    [parser]
    --- Front-end pass
    trans1     Transformation phase 1.
    anal1      Analysis phase 1.
    typify1    Type analysis and transformation 1.
    promo      Operand promotion phase.
    trans2     Transformation phase 2.
    fold       Constant folding.
    trans3     Transformation phase 3.
    typify2    Type analysis and transformation 2.
    anal2      Analysis phase 2.
    --- Middle-end pass
    fold       Constant folding.
    trans4     Transformation phase 4.
    analf      Analysis final phase.
    --- Back-end pass
    gen        Code generation.

The phases above are organized in several passes:

Pass1
  trans1 anal1 typify1 promo trans2 fold trans3 typify2 anal2
Pass2
  fold trans4 analf
Pass3
  gen

Naming Conventions for Phases
.............................

We use the following convention to name phases::

  {NAME}{SUFFIX}

where ``NAME`` reflects a phase category (see below) and ``SUFFIX`` is
usually an integer that specifies the order in which the phases are
applied.  Thus, for example, ``name4`` is performed after ``name1``.
Sometimes, ``SUFFIX`` is ``f`` (meaning "final").

The suffix is not used if there is only one phase in the given
category.

We use the following phase categories:

anal
  For phases whose main purpose is to perform checks on the AST,
  and/or the contents of the AST nodes, and emit errors/warnings.

trans
  For phases whose main purpose is to alter the structure of the AST,
  and/or the contents of the AST nodes.

typify
  For phases whose main purpose is to perform type checks, and
  otherwise do work on types.

promo
  For phases whose main purpose is to perform coercions wherever
  appropriate.  Currently there is only one phase in this category.

fold
  For phases whose main purpose is to pre-compute areas of the AST
  whenever it is possible to do so at compile-time.  Currently there
  is only one phase in this category, that performs constant folding.

gen
  For phases whose main purpose is to generate PVM code.  Currently
  there is only one phase in this category.

The phases in category ``NAME`` are implemented in the source files
``libpoke/pkl-NAME.[ch]``.


Naming Conventions for Handlers
...............................

We use the following convention to name phase handlers::

  pkl_PHASE_{ps,pr}_NODE

where ``PHASE`` can be a complete phase name (like ``typify1``) if the
handler is to be installed in that phase only, or a phase category
name (like ``typify``) if the handler is to be installed in several
phases in that category.  If the phase is to be executed in pre-order,
``pr`` follows, otherwise, ``ps``.  Finally, ``NODE`` is the name of
the AST node.

For example, the handler::

  pkl_anal1_ps_comp_stmt

is installed in the phase ``anal1``, executes in post-order, and
serves the AST nodes with code ``PKL_AST_COMP_STMT``.


Transformation Phases
.....................

trans1
  - Finishes strings by expanding \-sequences, emitting diagnostics if
    an invalid \-sequence is found.
  - Computes and set the number of elements in STRUCT nodes.
  - Computes and sets the number of elements, fields and declarations
    in struct TYPE nodes.
  - Completes offsets with implicit magnitude by adding a magnitude of
    int<32>1.
  - Calculates the number of arguments in FUNCALL nodes.
  - Annotates declaration nodes as being directly contained in struct
    type nodes.
  - Annotates variables that refer to recursive function calls as
    recursive.
  - Annotates variables with the enclosing function, and with their
    lexical nesting level with respect the beginning of the enclosing
    function.
  - Variables that refer to parameterless functions are transformed
    into funcalls to these functions.
  - Finalizes ATTR node by determining the operation corresponding to
    the attribute name, turning the IDENTIFIERxEXP binary expression
    into an unary expression.
  - Annotates a function's first optional argument and the number of
    formal arguments.
  - Completes function types with their number of formal arguments,
    annotates its first optional argument, and determines whether the
    function type gets a vararg.
  - Completes trimmers with implicit indexes, i.e. [N:], [:N] or [:],
    by adding the missing index as an appropriate expression.
  - Decodes format strings in printf statements.
  - Computes and sets the indexes of all the elements of an ARRAY node
    (array literal) and sets the size of the array.
  - Annotates compound statements with the number of variable and
    function declarations occurring within the statement.

trans2
  - Annotates expression nodes that are literals, i.e. expressions
    whose values can be computed at compile-time.
  - Annotates offsets, arrays, indexers, trimmers, structs, struct
    references, and casts as literals.
  - Turn struct references that refer to parameterless methods into
    funcalls to these methods.
  - In offsets whose units are type names, make sure these types are
    copmlete and replace the unit with an expression that evaluates to
    the size of the unit type, in bits.

trans3
  - SIZEOF nodes whose operand is a complete type are replaced with an
    offset.

trans4
  - Reverses the list of initializers in array literals.

Analysis Phases
...............

anal1
  - Checks that the elements in struct literals have unique names.
  - Checks that the elements in struct types have unique names.
  - Checks that declarations in unions appear before any of the
    alternatives.
  - Checks that builtin compound statements don't contain statements.
  - Check that the actual arguments passed to a funcall are all either
    named or none named.
  - Check that named arguments to funcalls are passed only once.
  - Check that all optional formal arguments in a function specifier
    are located at the end of the arguments list.
  - Check that function specifiers have at most one vararg argument,
    and that it is located at the end of the formal arguments list.
  - Check that function types have at most one vararg argument, and
    that it is located at the end of the formal arguments list.
  - Check that every BREAK statement have a containing statement.
  - Check that every RETURN statement have a containing function.
  - If the unit in an offset type specifier is specified using an
    integral constant, this constant should be bigger than zero.
  - The unit of an offset literal, if expressed as an integral, shall
    be bigger than zero.
  - Check that the bit count operator in left shift operations are
    less than the number of bits of the shifted operand.  This is
    checked in cases where the bit count is constant.
  - Methods can only be defined in a struct type.
  - The initializing expressions in unit declarations should be
    integer nodes.
  - Only methods can call other methods.
  - Methods are not allowed to refer to variables and functions
    defined in struct types.
  - A method can only refer to struct fields and methods defined in
    the same struct type.
  - Functions recursively defined inside methods are not allowed to
    refer to struct fields and methods.
  - Only methods can assign struct fields as variables.

anal2
  - Every expression, array and struct node should be annotated with a
    type, and the type's completeness should have been determined.
  - The magnitude in  offset literals should be an integral
    expression.
  - The magnitude in offset literals should have a type and its
    completeness should be known.
  - A return statement returning a value is not allowed in a void
    function.
  - An expressionless return statement is invalid in a non-void
    function.
  - A funcall to a void function is only allowed in an
    expression-statement.
  - Endianness specifiers in struct fields are only valid when applied
    to integral types.
  - In unions, alternatives appearing after an alternative with no
    constraint expression, or a constant expression known to be true,
    are unreachable.  Warn about this.
  - If an union alternative has a constraint known to be false, it is
    never taken.  Warn about this.
  - Optional fields are not supported in unions.
  - The indexes in array initializers should be constant.

analf
  - Every array initializer should have an index.
  - Check that the left-hand side of assignment statements are of the
    right kind.

Type System Phases
..................

typify1
  - Checks that the expression in which a funcall is applied is a
    function, and that the types of the formal parameters mach the
    types of the funcall arguments.
  - Checks that void functions are not called in contexts where a
    value is expected.

typify2
  - Checks that the type of the expression in a return statement
    matches the return type of its containing function.

Front and Middle End Handlers should be Re-entrant
..................................................

When a type is referenced by name, for example in a map::

  Foo @ 0#B

The AST associated with the type is processed again thru the compiler
middle-end phases.  This means that if a handler modifies an AST
subtree, it should either do it in a way the new structure will be
still valid if submitted to the same handler again.

An example of this is the ``pkl_trans1_ps_print_stmt`` handler.

More generally, the front-end and middle-end passes are restartable.
This means that every handler in these phases shall be re-entrant: if
executed more than once, they should do The Right Thing (TM).

The Type System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the type system implemented in the 'poke'
language.

Type Expressions
................

A *type expression* denotes some particular type.  Type expressions
can be one of:

A *simple type*
  Simple types are types that are not composed of other types.  In
  this discussion we use the following sexp-like notations for them:

  (int N)
    Signed integer of N bits, where 0 < N <= 64.
  (uint N)
    Likewise, but the integer is unsigned.
  string
    NULL-terminated C-like string.
  void
    This is the null type.  Used for several purposes.

A *product*
  Products of two type expressions are used to aggregate types in more
  complex structures, such as lists.  We denote them by using the
  following sexp-like notation:

  (T1 . T2)
    product of the type expressions T1 and T2.

  In order to simplify, we use the same list abbreviation used by Lisp
  in order to denote aggregations of types built with products::

    (T1 . (T2 . (T3 . T4))) -> (T1 T2 T3 T4)
  
  Note that type products are not really valid types by themselves.

An *array type*

A *struct type*
  Type expressions for structs are characterized by many attributes.
  We denote these expressions by using the following sexp-like
  notation.

  (struct PINNED ((L1 N1 T1 C1)...))
     where L1 is the label of the first element: a poke expression
     evaluating to an offset.  N1 is the name of the element, which is
     optional.  T1 is a type expression denoting the type of the
     element.  C1 is a poke expression evaluating to a boolean; it is
     the constraint associated to the element.   Of all these
     attributes, only T1 is mandatory.  PINNED is a boolean indicating
     whether structs having this type are pinned.

A *function type*
  Type expressions for functions are characterized by a type
  expression denoting the types of its arguments and the type of the
  value returned by the function.  We denote them using the following
  sexp-like notation:

  (fun T1 T2)
    where T1 is the type of the arguments to the function, and T2 is
    the type of the value returned by the function.

  Usually T1 will be an aggregation of types built as nested
  products.  For example, the type expression for a function that
  takes three 32-bit signed integers and returns a string is::

    (fun ((int 32) (int 32) (int 32)) string)

  If a type expression denotes the type of a function which doesn't
  take any argument, T1 should be 'void'.  Likewise, if the function
  doesn't return a value, T2 should be 'void'.

Adding Compiler Built-Ins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compiler built-ins are predefined functions, provided by the compiler,
that generate particular assembler instructions.

The first step in defining a new built-in is to make the lexer to
recognize tokens of the form ``__PKL_BUILTIN_NAME__`` where ``NAME``
is some meaningful name, like for example ``RAND``::

  "__PKL_BUILTIN_RAND__" { return BUILTIN_RAND; }

Then, add a new rule to the rule ``comp_stmt`` in the bison parser.
Built-ins are equivalent to compound statements.  For example, this is
the rule for the rand built-in::

          | pushlevel BUILTIN_RAND
        {
          $$ = pkl_ast_make_builtin (pkl_parser->ast,
                                     PKL_AST_BUILTIN_RAND);
          PKL_AST_LOC ($$) = @$;
          
          /* Pop the frame pushed by the `pushlevel' above.  */
          pkl_parser->env = pkl_env_pop_frame (pkl_parser->env);
        }

Next step is to generate the code for the built-in.  This is done
expanding the ``pkl_gen_ps_comp_stmt`` rule in the code generation.
Keep in mind that the generated code should conform a valid function
body.  For example, this is the code generation part for rand::

          case PKL_AST_BUILTIN_RAND:
          pkl_asm_insn (PKL_GEN_ASM, PKL_INSN_RAND);
          pkl_asm_insn (PKL_GEN_ASM, PKL_INSN_RETURN);
          break;

The final step is to define the built-in function proper, in the
compiler run-time, in ``pkl-rt.pk``::

  defun rand = int<32>: __PKL_BUILTIN_RAND__;


The Poke Virtual Machine
------------------------

Exception Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exception types or codes are signed 32-bit integers, and are defined
in ``libpoke/pkl-rt.pk`` as ``EC_*`` variables.

The exceptions themselves are struct values of type Exception, also
defined in ``libpoke/pkl-rt.pk``.

There are two ways an exception can be raised in the PVM:

- Explicitly, when the instruction ``raise`` is executed.
- Implicitly, when some instruction needs to fail.  For example,
  an integer division instruction divides by zero.

In either case, the treatment of a raised exception is the same:

1. Pop an exception handler from the exception handler stack.
2. If the exception handler matches the raised exception type, then
   i. Restore the heights of the main and return stacks.
   ii. Restore the dynamic environment.
   iii. Push the cached exception type to the stack.
   iv. Branch to the exception handler.
3. Repeat.

The default exception handler, which catches "unhandled" exceptions,
is installed by the macro-assembler in
``libpoke/pkl-asm.c:pkl_asm_new`` and
``libpoke/pkl-asm.c:pkl_asm_finish``.  It calls the function
``_pkl_exception_handler``, that is defined in the compiler runtime in
``libpoke/pkl-rt.pkl``.

Signal Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the PVM is about to execute a program, it installs a signal
handler that, at the moment, handles ``SIGINT``.  This signal handler
is defined in the ``late-c`` block in pvm.jitter, and records the
signal in the PVM internal state.

Then, when a ``sync`` instruction is executed, it checks the PVM
internal state and raises a ``PVM_E_SIGNAL`` exception if there is
some pending signal.  The default signal handler just ignores this
signal, but the user can also intercept it if desired.  The PKL
compiler generates ``sync`` instructions in strategic places, such as
before backward jumps in loops.

The ``exit`` PVM instruction clears the pending signals in the
internal PVM state.

Offsets and bit-offsets in the PVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PVM supports a ``pvm_off`` boxed value, to denote pairs of
magnitudes and units.  Both accessor macros (in ``pvm-val.h``) and PVM
instructions (``ogetm``, ``ogetu``) are provided to access their
components.

Many other PVM entities need to denote offsets in a way or another.
For example, struct fields in ``pvm_struct`` values need to record
their relative offset with respect the beginning of the struct.

It may come to mind, quite naturally, to use ``pvm_off`` values to
denote these offsets.  It is very elegant.  However, we decided to use
"bit offsets" instead, stored in 64-bit ``pvm_long`` values.

There are two reasons for this:

- First of all, performance.  It is fairly common to operate with the
  absolute value of these offsets, in bits.  In fact, in most cases
  that is the only purpose of maintaining them.  Having them stored in
  ``pvm_off`` values means we have to multiply every time we want to
  get their magnitude.  This is a waste, for no good reason.

- To avoid code coupling.  PVM offsets are very cool, but they are
  also complex: the unit is arbitrary.  This means in many cases we
  have to assume the nature of the unit, mainly bits.  This is very
  fragile.

So, the take-home message is: in the PVM, restrict the presence of
``pvm_off`` values to the ones generated by the code generator.
Whenever an offset is needed in some internal PVM structure, use
bit-offsets instead encoded as ``ulong<64>`` values.

Memory Management
-----------------

Different parts of poke use different strategies for memory
management:

- The compiler front-end uses reference counting to handle AST nodes.

- The PVM uses the Boehm GC collector for values and the run-time
  environment.

- Everything else uses ``malloc``/``free``.

This sometimes leads to tricky situations, some of which are
documented in the subsections below.

Using ASTREF
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AST uses reference counting in order to manage the memory used by
the nodes.  Every time you store a pointer to an AST node, you should
use the macro ``ASTREF`` in order to increase its counter::

  pkl_ast_node foo = ASTREF (node);

Note that the ``pkl_ast_make_*`` constructors do ``ASTREF``
internally, so you don't need to use it in calls like::

  pkl_ast_node new = pkl_ast_make_struct (ast, 5, elems_node);

There is a little caveat: the way ASTREF is defined, it requires a
l-value to work properly.  Therefore, this doesn't work::

  pkl_ast_node foo = ASTREF (PKL_AST_TYPE (node));

instead, write::

  pkl_ast_node type = PKL_AST_TYPE (node);
  pkl_ast_node foo = ASTREF (type);


Using ASTDEREF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ASTDEREF`` decreases the reference counter of the provided AST
node.  The passed value should be a l-value.

In practice you will seldom find yourself in the need to use
``ASTDEREF``.  Just make sure that every ``ASTREF`` is paired with a
``pkl_ast_node_free``.

However, there are situations where ``ASTDEREF`` is necessary in order
to avoid a memory leak.  For example, consider transformations like ``a
-> b`` to ``a -> x -> b``.  In that case, you should use something
like::

  b = PKL_AST_KIND_WHAT (node);
  x = pkl_ast_make_xxx (ast, ASTDEREF (b));
  PKL_AST_KIND_WHAT (node) = ASTREF (x);

This works because ``pkl_ast_make_xxx`` does an ``ASTREF`` to ``b``
internally.  The final result is that the reference counter of ``b``
doesn't change at all.
  
PVM values in PVM programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PVM routines (data structures of type ``pvm_routine``) are
allocated by Jitter in complicated data structures, internally relying
on ``malloc``.  Their content is therefore not automatically visible to
the GC.

Now, the instructions in a routine can contain literal PVM values, and
some of these values will be boxed.  For example, the following
routine contains a pointer to a ``pvm_val_box``::

  ;; Initialize the element index to 0UL, and put it
  ;; in a local.
  push ulong<64>0
  regvar $eidx

There is only one place where jitter routines are stored in other data
structures: the PVM program abstraction.

PVM programs are allocated using ``pvm_alloc``, i.e. by the GC.  They
are composed by a PVM routine and other fields::

  struct pvm_program
  {
    pvm_routine routine;
    [...]
  }

However, since ``routine`` is malloc-allocated, the GC can't traverse
it.  Consequently, the references to contained boxed values won't be
accounted for, and these values will be collected if there are no more
references to them!

The solution, recommended by Luca Saiu, is to keep an array of
pointers in the PVM program structure, containing the pointers to
every boxed value used in ``routine``::

  struct pvm_program
  {
    pvm_routine routine;
    void **pointers;
    [...]
  };

The pointers are collected in the ``pvm-program.c`` functions that
append parameters to instructions.

PVM values in AST nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Storing a PVM value (whose memory is handled by GC) in an AST node
(reference-counted) leads to a problem: the GC is unable to see the
reference to values, and will therefore collect the memory if there
are no other reachable references.

Let's see an example of this.  Both array and struct types contain
closures for mappers, writers, bounders, and the like.  For example,
let's take arrays::

    struct pkl_ast_type
    {
        ...
        struct
        {
          union pkl_ast_node *bound;
          union pkl_ast_node *etype;
          pvm_val mapper;
          pvm_val writer;
          pvm_val bounder;
        } array;
    }

In this case, ``mapper``, ``writer`` and ``bounder`` are managed by
GC.  However, the contained ``struct pkl_ast_type`` is not.  There is
no way the GC can find these nodes thru the AST node.

The solution is to declare the relevant pointers in the containing AST
node as GC roots.  The right place to do that is in the corresponding
constructor in ``pkl-ast.c``.  For example::

  pkl_ast_node
  pkl_ast_make_array_type (pkl_ast ast, pkl_ast_node etype, pkl_ast_node bound)
  {
    ...
    /* The closure slots are GC roots.  */
    pvm_alloc_add_gc_roots (&PKL_AST_TYPE_A_MAPPER (type), 1);
    pvm_alloc_add_gc_roots (&PKL_AST_TYPE_A_WRITER (type), 1);
    pvm_alloc_add_gc_roots (&PKL_AST_TYPE_A_BOUNDER (type), 1);
    ...
  }

And of course, before the memory of the AST node is freed, these roots
should be unregistered from the GC.  The right place to do this is in
``pkl_ast_node_free``::

  void
  pkl_ast_node_free (pkl_ast_node ast)
  {
    ...
    case PKL_AST_TYPE:
      switch (PKL_AST_TYPE_CODE (ast))
        {
        ...
        case PKL_TYPE_ARRAY:
          /* Remove GC roots.  */
          pvm_alloc_remove_gc_roots (&PKL_AST_TYPE_A_MAPPER (ast), 1);
          pvm_alloc_remove_gc_roots (&PKL_AST_TYPE_A_WRITER (ast), 1);
          pvm_alloc_remove_gc_roots (&PKL_AST_TYPE_A_BOUNDER (ast), 1);
        }
  }

So if you add PVM values or PVM environments to an AST node, please
follow the strategy above.

Terminal Handling
-----------------

pk-term
~~~~~~~

Writing to the terminal, and getting information from the terminal, is
handled by the ``pk-term`` module.  It provides functions to:

- Write strings to the standard output.

- Write formatted strings to the standard output, ala ``printf``.

- Handle output "classes", which are the base of styling.

Out terminal abstraction is implemented of top of GNU libtextstyle.
In case it is not available when building poke, a dummy stub is
provided by gnulib.  In that case output won't be styled, but poke
will still compile and run properly.

Styling Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Styling is handled using "classes", which are identified by some
string.  Using ``pk_term`` calls, enclosed environments can be
defined::

  pk_term_class ("foo");
  /* Text emitted here has class "foo"  */
  pk_term_class ("bar");
  /* Text emitted here has class "foo" and "bar" */
  pk_term_end_class ("bar");
  pk_term_end_class ("foo");

The ``class`` and ``end_class`` calls should be properly paired.

The styling classes used in poke should be documented in the user
manual, so the user will know what is suitable to be configured.
Also, whenever possible a reasonable default shall be provided in
``poke-default.css``.

Debugging Styling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As recommended in the libtextstyle manual, a good way to see the class
hierarchy of some given output is to run poke passing the
``--color=html`` option::

  $ poke --color=html
  [...]
  (poke) [1#B,2#B]
  <span class="array">[<span class="offset"><span class="integer">0x1</span>#B</span>,<span class="offset"><span class="integer">0x2</span>#B</span>]</span><br/>(poke) 

Debugging Poke
--------------

Building with Debugging support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Short summary: at the present time Poke and its Jittery VM are not
especially difficult to debug; however the situation is going to
change as Jitter evolves and the following details will become more
important to Poke hackers.

In order to make debugging easier you may want to disable advanced
dispatches in Jitter, which make the generated code harder to follow
and confuse GDB.

Jitter by default will use the most efficient dispatch which is both
stable and available for the current configuration.  The remark about
stability is important: at the time of writing there are still bugs
in the two most advanced dispatching modes, ``minimal-threading`` and
``no-threading``, which may result in subtly incorrect compiled code.
For this reason Jitter disables those dispatches by default; they will
be re-enabled in Jitter as soon as they are deemed ready for production
use, at which point Poke will make use of them automatically.

Jitter supports two alternative dispatches, slower but very stable
and friendly to debugging: ``switch`` and ``direct-threading``.

Any dispatch can be selectively enabled or disabled from the Poke
``configure`` script, by passing the following options which will be
automatically relayed to Jitter's ``configure`` script:

- ``--enable-dispatch-switch``
- ``--disable-dispatch-switch``
- ``--enable-dispatch-direct-threading``
- ``--disable-dispatch-direct-threading``
- ``--enable-dispatch-minimal-threading``
- ``--disable-dispatch-minimal-threading``
- ``--enable-dispatch-no-threading``
- ``--disable-dispatch-no-threading``

When configured in sub-package mode, as is the case when used with
Poke, Jitter will only actually compile the single most efficient
enabled dispatch.

Invoking GDB to debug an uninstalled poke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we are using libtool, ``$(builddir)/poke/poke`` is a shell
script.  In order to debug the uninstalled poke, you can do::

  $ ./libtool --mode=execute ./run gdb poke/poke

Using GDB extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the GDB pretty-printers and other goodies brought to
you courtesy of the poke hackers, just source the poke-gdb.scm file
from your debugger::

  (gdb) source etc/poke-gdb.scm

Valgrind and Poke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PVM uses the Boehm conservative garbage collector in order to
manage the memory used by the VM values.  Other parts of poke, such as
the PKL compiler, manage their own memory.

Valgrind gets easily confused by the GCs tampering with the stack, and
emits a lot of spurious warnings.  Fortunately it is possible to tell
memcheck to omit these warnings: the file etc/boehm-gc.suppresions
contains a list of suppressions.

Invoke valgrind with ``--suppressions=etc/boehm-gc.suppressions``.

If despite using the suppressions file you see some spurious warning,
please use::

  $ valgrind --tool=memcheck --gen-suppressions=all --log-file=raw.log


Then process raw.log with the ``etc/parse-valgrind-suppressions.sh``
script, wildcard the result as much as you can, and append the results
to ``etc/boehm-gc.suppressions``.

In order to run the testsuite with valgrind, edit ``lib/poke-dg.exp`` and
uncomment the lines::

 set VALGRIND "valgrind --quiet \
               --suppressions=${srcdir}/../etc/boehm-gc.suppressions \
               --tool=memcheck --gen-suppressions=all"

Then run ``make check`` as usual.

Debugging PVM Assembly Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hacking some areas of the compiler, such as the code generator pass,
involves meta-programming PVM assembler.  It is easy to find examples
anywhere in ``libpoke/pkl-gen.c``::

  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_ROT);
  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_MULLU);
  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_NIP2);

Or, alternatively, the code may be written in RAS in a ``.pks`` file.
Like::

  .loop:
        bz @type, .endloop      ; ... A B
        mod @type               ; ... A B A%B
        rot                     ; ... B A%B A
        drop                    ; ... B A%B
        ba .loop

Often, a run-time problem becomes apparent while the PVM executes the
generated code.  Typical cases are when a PVM value doesn't contain
what it's supposed to contain, and accessing the wrong boxed value
causes a segmentation fault (if we are lucky) or a non-crashing
invalid memory access (if we are very unlucky.)  Whenever that kind of
crap happens, we find ourselves in the need of debugging the PVM code,
which is a big PITA.

Bad news are: we don't have a PVM debugger (yet).
Good news are: we have a couple of tools that may help.

The first of such tools is the ``prints`` instruction.  This
instructions basically prints in the standard output the string value
on the TOS, and then drops it.  It is a wonderful way to trace PVM
code.

For example, let's say we are trying to find out how many times the
loop above gets executed.  We can install traces like::

        push "XXX entering loop\n"
        prints
  .loop:
        push "XXX in loop\n"
        prints
        mod @type
        rot
        drop
        ba .loop

The other tool is the ``strace`` instruction.  It prints the contents
of the stack (one value per line) from the TOS.  It gets the number of
stack values to print as an argument, 0 meaning all of them.  It is
very useful in many situations, like when a loop is composing values
in the stack and something is going banana.  It is also useful to
determine what kind of value is being accessed by a given instruction.

For example, lets say that we are hunting some segmentation fault.  We
highly suspect the code generated in the first example in this
section, above.  Of the three instructions, ``mullu`` is the only one
that could conceivably generate a segfault, so we add a stack trace
instruction right before it to inspect its two arguments::

  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_ROT);
  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_STRACE, 2); /* XXX remove me */
  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_MULLU);
  pkl_asm_insn (pasm, PKL_INSN_NIP2);

We recompile, re-run, and we find out that the elements at the TOS
when ``mullu`` is executed are a pair of stupid signed integers, which
are not boxed and not what the instruction expects.  Mystery solved.

Future Developments
-------------------

- Allow variable expressions in array initializer indexes.  Something
  like::

    [1,[foo*2]=666]

  this will of course mean that the types of literal arrays won't be
  necessarily be bounded by a constant number of elements.  No big
  deal.

- Allow anonymous initializers in struct constructors.  Something
  like::

    deftype Foo = struct { int i; long j; }
    Foo { i = 10, j = 20L }

- Allow coercions in struct constructors.  Currently this is not
  supported::

    deftype Foo = struct { int i; }
    Foo { i = 10L }

- Doing compile-type static checking for union alternatives, if fields
  with the same names are allowed, will require unification::

    deftype Foo = union { int x : ...; string x; };
    defvar f = Foo @ 0#B;
    f.x = "foo";
