/* An IO space operates on one or more "IO devices", which are
   abstractions providing pread and pwrite byte-oriented operations.
   Typical abstracted entities are files stored in some file system,
   the memory of a process, etc.

   Since the IO devices are byte-oriented, aspects like endianness,
   alignment and negative encoding are not of consideration.

   IOD offsets shall always be interpreted as numbers of bytes.  */
